QUESTIONS

1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?

A: Pseudocode is used to develop algorithms without worrying about a specific language's syntax. This allows programmers to stub out code focused on logic and functionality rather than language nuances. Pseudocode is also helpful in allowing programmers to communicate effectively with those unfamiliar with languages outside their stack. 

2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

A: Running pseudocode on your computer wouldn't do anything but trigger error messages. 

PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENT

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number. 

INPUT first number 
INPUT second number
IF first number is greater than second number
	PRINT first number
ELSE
	PRINT second number
END IF 

2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100. 

INIT number to 1
WHILE number is less than or equal to 100
	PRINT number
	ADD 1 to number 
END WHILE 

3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

INPUT phonenumber
FOR iterate through array called phonenumbers
	IF phonenumber equals item in array phonenumbers
		PRINT phonenumber
	ELSE check next item in array
	END IF
END FOR

4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

const phonenumbers = [(array of phonenumbers)];

function findNumber(phonenumber) {
	for (i = 0; i < phonenumbers.length; i++) {
		if (phonenumber === phonenumbers[i]) {
		return phonenumber
	  }	else {
	}
   }
 };
