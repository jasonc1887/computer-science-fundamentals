Intro to Data Structures 

1. 

a) 

let people = ["Vivian", "Ava", "Josh", "Patrick", "Mike"];

b)

people.push("Mary");

c)

function findJosh() {
  for (i=0; i < people.length; i++) {
    if (people[i] === "Josh") {
      console.log(i);
    }
  }
};
console.log(findJosh());

d)

function findEmily() {
  for (i=0; i < people.length; i++) {
    if (people[i] === "Emily") {
      console.log(i);
    } else {
      return "Emily is not in line";
    }
  }
};
console.log(findEmily());

e) 

people.splice(1, 0, "Melissa");


f)

people.splice(3, 1);

2. 
Provide another real-world example that you can model using a data structure.

A: A music festival lineup and the order bands are scheduled to perform. 

["Misfits", "Bad Brains", "Minor Threat", "NOFX"] etc. 

3. 
How would your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?

A: Developers could access bands in array by their index and/or name and can manipulate using array methods.
